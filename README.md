# Neovim


Works for any **Neovim 0.8.0 or newer** .  
  
To use this directory do

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anuragak021/Neovim
```
in the .config/nvim folder this will clone everything in folder named Neovim to move all the contents of this folder to up one folder do 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anuragak021/Neovim ~/.config/nvim
```
The Keyboard shorcuts that I have used are : 
<br> 
1. <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>K</kbd> -> Hover over a keyword
2.
